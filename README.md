I developed the project using Angular 8.

In order to run the project you must first make the sure Angular is installed on the machine and in the project.

In addition for the tabs and cards on the content page I used angular material, to install this you must run the command
  ng add @angular material

For the most part I focused on the functionality of what had to be done rather than the design.
I feel I hit all of the key points:
  1. User must enter an email address that is in the list of users to proceed to the next ("content") page
  2. User can see all their posts and by moving tab can see other users posts
  3. Users can add posts

Unfortnately, I didn't have time to unit test any of my functions although I would of done this through Karma.

I think the biggest thing I missed out on was the validation on the login page.
So if the user enters an incorrect email address they are not informed as to why they cannot move to the next page.
It also isn't ensured that what is entered is a valid email.
Had I had more time I would of used Angular forms to handle the validation.

Lastly, I would of improved the design as well. I would of used Angular material forms and buttons to improve the overall look of the application.

Thanks for taking the time to review my work

On another note:
During the test I was called up for a Covid-19 Vaccine from my local GP as I had put myself on the cancelation list. So from about 12:45 to 13:25 I was in the doctors getting the vaccine, hence why it took me longer than expected. I can provide a cert, if this effects my score in the test.
